An easy way for us to do this would be by analyzing some of the\nviewership statistics. Below, we have a graph that depicts the\nviewership in millions for the NBA Finals series. It is evident that the\nviewership reached its peak for the NBA Finals series during the Michael\nJordan era of basketball. After that, the viewership declined heavily;\nhowever, it looks to be back on the rise again.\n\n\n\nMoving on, we should also take a look at the reach basketball has on\nthe entire globe. This factor is important to consider since basketball\nwas only created in 1891, which is pretty late in comparison to other\nsports (sports like soccer have been around in some fashion since as far\nback as 2500 BC). \nNonetheless, the visualization below allows us to judge basketball’s\nreach by showing us where the players of the NBA have come from.\n\n\n\nAnother very important factor when considering the popularity of a\nsport is its financial value. Since sports are part of the entertainment\nindustry, one of the most telling ways for us to determine its success\nis to analyze the amount of value they hold. As we can see, the graphic\nbelow shows us that although the NBA may not currently be the league\nwith the highest average franchise value, they are one of the leagues\nwith the highest increases, which is a good sign for the future. There\nare other non-American leagues to consider as well, but for the sake of\nthis analysis, we will focus more towards the American sports\nleagues.\n\n\n\nStatistics of the Game\n\n\n\nOne of the main things that fans mention when asked about some of the\nbiggest advancements in basketball is the evolution of the three-point\nline. Introduced in 1979, the three-point line has provided players an\nopportunity to make more points for a made shot than the standard\ntwo-point basket. Since then, the implementation of this three-point\nline into the game-plans of coaches has increased significantly, as\nshown by the graph above.\n\n\n\nThe graphic above signifies a slight decline in offensive rebound\nrates over time; however, from the previous plot, we also know there has\nbeen an increase in the percentage of points home teams have gained\nthrough three-pointers. Therefore, it is plausible that the decrease in\noffensive rebounds is due to increased floor stretching caused by the\nincrease in three-point play schema usage.\n\n\n\nOther important statistics for basketball analytics as a whole\nincludes categories such as assists, steals, and blocks, as depicted in\nthe graph above. Although there have been a few minor trends in these\nareas over time, there isn’t really anything too important to note.\n\nOther Trends\n\n\n\nThe graphic above displays the records of teams across the leagues\nfrom different time periods. Although the overall relationship between\nwins and losses is pretty similar across the time periods, we can see a\nclear difference in variation among some of the older win-loss records.\nHowever, it is to be noted that these observations are not very\nsignificant.\n\n\n\n",
