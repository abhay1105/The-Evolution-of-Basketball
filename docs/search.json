      "contents": "\nThe Popularity of the Sport\nLet’s first start by taking a look at the overall popularity of the sport of basketball itself. An easy way for us to do this would be by analyzing some of the viewership statistics. Below, we have a graph that depicts the viewership in millions for the NBA Finals series. It is evident that the viewership reached its peak for the NBA Finals series during the Michael Jordan era of basketball. After that, the viewership declined heavily; however, it looks to be back on the rise again.\n\n\n\nMoving on, we should also take a look at the reach basketball has on the entire globe. This is important since basketball was only created in 1891, which is pretty late considering other sports like soccer have been around in some fashion since as far back as 2500 BC. Nonetheless, the visualization below allows us to judge this by showing us where the players of the NBA have come from.\n\n# A tibble: 83 x 2\n   birthPlace             total\n   <fct>                  <int>\n 1 Argentina                 12\n 2 Australia                 21\n 3 Austria                    1\n 4 Bahamas                    5\n 5 Belgium                    3\n 6 Bosnia and Herzegovina    13\n 7 Brazil                    16\n 8 Bulgaria                   1\n 9 Cameroon                   4\n10 Canada                    33\n# … with 73 more rows\n       long      lat group order region subregion\n1 -69.89912 12.45200     1     1  Aruba      <NA>\n2 -69.89571 12.42300     1     2  Aruba      <NA>\n3 -69.94219 12.43853     1     3  Aruba      <NA>\n4 -70.00415 12.50049     1     4  Aruba      <NA>\n5 -70.06612 12.54697     1     5  Aruba      <NA>\n6 -70.05088 12.59707     1     6  Aruba      <NA>\n\n\nAnother very important factor when considering the popularity of a sport is its financial value. Since sports are part of the entertainment industry, one of the most telling ways for us to determine its success is to analyze the amount of value they hold. As we can see, the graphic below shows us that although the NBA may not currently be the league with the highest average franchise value, they are one of the leagues with the highest increases, which is a good sign for the future. There are other non-American leagues to consider as well, but for the sake of this analysis will focus more towards the American sports leagues.\n\n\n\nStatistics of the Game\n\n\n\nOne of the main things that fans mention when asked about some of the biggest advancements in basketball is the evolution of the three-point line. Introduced in 1979, the three-point line has provided players an opportunity to make more points for a made shot than the standard two-point. Since then, the implementation of this three-point line into the gameplan of coaches has increased significantly, as shown by the graph above.\n\n\n\nThe graphic above signifies a slight decline in offensive rebound rates over time; however, from the previous plot, we also know there has been an increase in the percentage of points home teams have gained through three-pointers. Therefore, it is plausible that the decrease in offensive rebounds is due to increased floor stretching caused by the increase in three-point play schema usage.\n\n\n\nOther important statistics for basketball analysis as a whole involve categories such as assists, steals, and blocks, as depicted in the graph above. Although there have been a few minor trends in these areas over time, there isn’t really anything too important we need to note down here.\n\nRows: 1,417\nColumns: 21\n$ Year               <chr> \"2016-17\", \"2015-16\", \"2014-15\", \"2013-14…\n$ Team               <chr> \"Celtics\", \"Celtics\", \"Celtics\", \"Celtics…\n$ Record             <chr> \"25-15\", \"48-34\", \"40-42\", \"25-57\", \"41-4…\n$ Winning.Percentage <dbl> 0.625, 0.585, 0.488, 0.305, 0.506, 0.591,…\n$ X                  <lgl> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N…\n$ X.1                <lgl> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N…\n$ X.2                <lgl> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N…\n$ X.3                <lgl> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N…\n$ X.4                <lgl> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N…\n$ X.5                <chr> \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"…\n$ X.6                <lgl> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N…\n$ X.7                <lgl> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N…\n$ X.8                <lgl> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N…\n$ X.9                <lgl> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N…\n$ X.10               <lgl> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N…\n$ X.11               <lgl> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N…\n$ X.12               <lgl> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N…\n$ X.13               <lgl> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N…\n$ X.14               <lgl> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N…\n$ X.15               <lgl> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N…\n$ X.16               <lgl> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, N…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
